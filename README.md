# Dogecoin Price Prediction using LSTM  
*(NUS FinTech Society Trainee Programme ‚Äì AY24/25 Sem 1 Final Project)*  

## üìå Introduction  
This project was completed as part of the **NUS FinTech Society Trainee Programme (AY24/25 Sem 1)**.  

The main objective is to apply **time series analysis** using a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network** to predict **Dogecoin (DOGE) price movements**.  

Cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin are known for their high volatility. Accurate forecasting of price trends can be valuable for research in financial technology, algorithmic trading, and market analysis.

## üìÇ Project Overview  
- **Data Source:** Historical Dogecoin price data.
- **Model Used:** Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) suitable for sequential and time-series data.  
- **Goal:** Leverage historical Dogecoin prices from the past 7 days to forecast future price movements using time series modeling.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methods  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Collected and cleaned Dogecoin price data  
   - Normalized values for stable training  

2. **Model Development**  
   - Built an LSTM model using TensorFlow/Keras  
   - Tuned hyperparameters
   - Trained on historical time series data  

3. **Evaluation**  
   - Evaluated the performance of the LSTM model using validation accuracy.
